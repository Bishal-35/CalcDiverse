## Description :-

A Circle Equation Solver is helps solve or derive key characteristics of a circle based on its equation. Specifically, it can take an equation of a circle (in either standard or general form) and calculate the center and radius of the circle, or it can convert between different forms of the equation.

A Circle Equation Solver takes an equation of a circle and either:

- Extracts the center and radius from the equation.
- Converts the equation from one form to another (e.g., from general form to standard form).
- Solves for unknowns, such as the center coordinates or radius, based on the given information


Examples:

**Input:** 

Standard Form : (x-3)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 16

**Output:** 

Centre: (3 , -2)            
Radius: 4

General Form : x² + y² -6x +4y -3 = 0
